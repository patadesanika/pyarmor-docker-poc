yU6LFbeJu3nidMX7UIWC69P3t7RmfydRNNMUyjLu-bWichP8nhZpgIYMoArNHsyG8ohAtmK8Nqk_NQEm4Gybio7mlqgnPML4Yeh-jv54pjdx4BxucVmevhL9hLAdRMunS-K9DpRQCKvZ2LNeR49d7d4awGKu31yaPj66GYCX5N4QLk-YEz2R4dI7GwKmWHVV

Internet connection and Pyarmor 9.0+ are required to activate this code, install Pyarmor and check Pyarmor version by this command

    pip install -U pyarmor
    pyarmor -v

Here are initial registration steps:

1. Download the attachment of this email, save it as "pyarmor-regcode-8153.txt"

2. Run the following command to activate this license, please replace "XXX" with your product name which need to be obfuscated by Pyarmor or "non-profits" (only for obfuscating non-commercial projects)

     pyarmor reg -p XXX pyarmor-regcode-8153.txt

3. The registration file "pyarmor-regfile-8153.zip" will be created in the current path if this license is activated sucessfully

IMPORTANT NOTES:

* Please backup "pyarmor-regcode-8153.txt", but do not use it to register Pyarmor
* Please backup regfile "pyarmor-regfile-8153.zip", and use this file for next any registration
* Do not use this file in docker container and CI/CD pipeline
* Pyarmor Team doesn't provide LOST FOUND SERVICE

CI License only works in CI/CD pipeline, "pyarmor-regfile-8153.zip" is only used to request CI regfile, it doesn't work in local machine to register Pyarmor

- In local device run the following command to request one CI regfile

      pyarmor reg -C pyarmor-regfile-8153.zip

  It will create one CI regfile "pyarmor-ci-8153.zip" in the current path

  Check CI license info in local machine

      pyarmor --home temp reg pyarmor-ci-8153.zip

- In CI/CD pipeline, register Pyarmor by CI regfile

      # Please replace "9.X.Y" with current Pyarmor version
      pip install pyarmor==9.X.Y
      pyarmor reg pyarmor-ci-8153.zip

  Check registration information in CI/CD pipeline

      pyarmor -v

Notes

* CI regfile "pyarmor-ci-8153.zip" will be expired about in 360 days
* Once CI regfile doesn't work, require new one
* CI regfile may not work in future Pyarmor version
* One license can request at most 100 CI regfiles
* Do not request CI regfile in CI/CD pipeline

In CI/CD pipeline, each run command `pyarmor gen` will send request to Pyarmor License Server, excessive requests or requests beyond normal usage may be rejected by Pyarmor License Server. Generally do not exceed any of these rate limits:

- 1 run per second
- 100 runs per hour
- 1,000 runs per day
- 10,000 runs per month

Please contact Pyarmor team (pyarmor@163.com) if your project need more runs.
